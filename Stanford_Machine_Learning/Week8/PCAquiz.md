Answer | Explanation 
--- | --- 
Choose k to be the smallest value so that at least 99% of the variance is retained | This maintains the structure of the data while maximally reducing its dimension.

True or False | Statement | Explanation 
--- | --- | ---
False | Once an example has been assigned to a particular centroid, it will never be reassigned to another centroid | Not sure yet
True | A good way to initialize K-means is to select K (distinct) examples from the training set and set the cluster centroids equal to these selected examples. | This is the recommended method of initialization.
