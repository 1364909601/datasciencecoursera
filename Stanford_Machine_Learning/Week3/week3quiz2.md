True or False | Statement | Explanation 
--- | --- | ---
False | Adding many new features to the model helps prevent overfitting on the training set. | Adding many new features gives us more expressive models which are able to better fit our training set. If too many new features are added, this can lead to overfitting of the training set.
False | Introducing regularization to the model always results in equal or better performance on examples <b> not </b> in the training set. | If we introduce too much regularization, we can underfit the training set and this can lead to worse performance even for examples not in the training set.
False | Introducing regularization to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set. | If we introduce too much regularization, we can underfit the training set and have worse performance on the training set.
True | Adding a new feature to the model always results in equal or better performance on the training set | Adding many new features gives us more expressive models which are able to better fit our training set. If too many new features are added, this can lead to overfitting of the training set.
