* There would be confounding because the number of people that live in an area is related to both Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.

* We couldn't be sure whether subscribing to Martha Steward Living causes people to be Users of Our Site or the other way around.

* We would be performing inference on the relationship between Martha Stewart Living Subscribers and Our Site's Users.

* We wouldn't know the sensitivity of our predictions.
