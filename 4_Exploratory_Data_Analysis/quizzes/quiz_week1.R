# Exploratory Data Analysis, Quiz 1 JHU Coursera

#1. 
# Which of the following is a principle of analytic graphics?

# Don't plot more than two variables at at time

# Integrate multiple modes of evidence

# Show box plots (univariate summaries)

# Make judicious use of color in your scatterplots

# Only do what your tools allow you to do

# solution: Integrate multiple modes of evidence

#2. 
# What is the role of exploratory graphs in data analysis?

# They are made for formal presentations.

# They are typically made very quickly.

# Axes, legends, and other details are clean and exactly detailed.

# Only a few are constructed.

# SOLUTION: They are typically made very quickly.

# 3. 
# Which of the following is true about the base plotting system?

# Plots are created and annotated with separate functions

# The system is most useful for conditioning plots

# Plots are typically created with a single function call

# Margins and spacings are adjusted automatically depending on the type of plot and the data

# SOLUTION: Plots are created and annotated with separate functions

# 4. 
# Which of the following is an example of a valid graphics device in R?

# A PNG file

# The keyboard

# A file folder

# A Microsoft Word document

# A socket connection

# SOLUTION: A PNG file

# 5. 
# Which of the following is an example of a vector graphics device in R?

# TIFF 

# GIF

# Postscript

# PNG

# JPEG 

# SOLUTION: SVG or Postscript

# 6. 
# Bitmapped file formats can be most useful for

# Scatterplots with many many points

# Plots that require animation or interactivity

# Plots that may need to be resized

# Plots that are not scaled to a specific resolution

# SOLUTION: Scatterplots with many many points

# 7. 
# Which of the following functions is typically used to add elements to a plot in the base graphics system?

# points()

# hist() 

# plot() 

# boxplot() 

# SOLUTION: text() or points() 

# 8. 
# Which function opens the screen graphics device for the Mac?

# quartz()

# bitmap()

# pdf()

# png()

# SOLUTION: quartz()

# 9. 
# What does the 'pch' option to par() control?

# the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

# the line width in the base graphics system

# the orientation of the axis labels on the plot

# the size of the plotting symbol in a scatterplot

# SOLUTION: the plotting symbol/character in the base graphics system

# 10
# If I want to save a plot to a PDF file, which of the following is a correct way of doing that?

# Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()

# Open the screen device with quartz(), construct the plot, and then close the device with dev.off().

# Open the PostScript device with postscript(), construct the plot, then close the device with dev.off().

# Construct the plot on the PNG device with png(), then copy it to a PDF with dev.copy2pdf().

# SOLUTION: Construct the plot on the screen device and then copy it to a PDF file with dev.copy2pdf()
